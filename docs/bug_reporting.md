# Internal Bug Reporting

Bugs reported internally usually come from three test flows/streams:

 1) Bugs reported during the Acceptance Testing of a new feature/story. And by Acceptance Testing we mean manually testing a new feature to verify that it complies with the acceptance criteria, design, and behaves as expected before merging this feature into `main`. Those bugs are labeled with `bug_acceptance`. For reporting those bugs, `Acceptance Testing Bug Report` issue template can be used.

 2) Bugs reported during any regular testing or regression testing of `main`. Those bugs are labeled with `bug_regression`. For reporting those bugs, `Bug Report` issue template can be used.

 3)  Bugs reported during testing a released version. Those bugs are labeled with `bug_release`. For reporting those bugs, `Bug Report` issue template can be used.


 Both issue templates are created by default with the label `team/pesto` attached to them. Make sure to add your teams label instead if the bug is within one of the domains handled by your team.
