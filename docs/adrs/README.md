## ADR == Architecture Decision Records

The ADR is a lightweight process for documenting these decisions. By storing them in the repository with the code, we will have a record and history.

The concept of ADRs originated in [Documenting architecture decisions - Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
