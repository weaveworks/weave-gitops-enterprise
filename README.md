## Overview

Weave GitOps enables an effective GitOps workflow for continuous delivery of applications into Kubernetes clusters.
It is based on [CNCF Flux](https://fluxcd.io), a leading GitOps engine.

## CLI/API development

To set up a development environment for the CLI

1. Install go v1.16
2. Install [buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf)
3. make or make unit-tests to ensure everything built correctly.

### unit testing

We are using [Ginko](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) for our unit tests. To execute the all the unit tests, run `make unit-tests`.

To run a single test, you will need to set the KUBEBUILDER_ASSESTS environment variable to point to the directory containing our mock K8s objects.

```bash
export KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/tools/bin/envtest
go test github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/pkg/kube
```

or

```bash
export KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/tools/bin/envtest
cd pkg/kube
go test
```

#### Executing a subset of tests

Ginkgo allows you to run a subset of Describe/Context/It specs. See [Focused Specs](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#focused-specs) for more information

### Setup golangci-lint in your editor

Link for golangci-lint editor integration: https://golangci-lint.run/usage/integrations/

For VSCode, use these editor configuration flags:

```json
    "go.lintFlags": [
        "--fast",
    ],
```

## UI Development

To set up a development environment for the UI

1. Install go v1.16
2. Install Node.js version 14.15.1
3. Make sure your `$GOPATH` is added to your `$PATH` in your bashrc or zshrc file, then install reflex for automated server builds: go get github.com/cespare/reflex
4. Go through the Weave GitOps getting started docs here: https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/getting-started/
5. Run `npm install` on this repo.
6. Make sure GitOps is installed on a fresh kind cluster for this repo by running `kind delete cluster`, `kind create cluster`, and finally `gitops install`.
7. To start up the HTTP server with automated re-compliation, run `make api-dev`
8. Run `npm start` to start the frontend dev server (with hot-reloading)

Lint frontend code with `make ui-lint` - using Prettier (https://prettier.io/) will get you on the right track!

Run frontend tests with `make ui-test` - update CSS snapshots with `npm run test -- -u`

Check dependency vulnerabilities with `make ui-audit`

### Recommended Snippets

To create a new styled React component (with typescript):

```json
{
  "Export Default React Component": {
    "prefix": "tsx",
    "body": [
      "import * as React from 'react';",
      "import styled from 'styled-components'",
      "",
      "type Props = {",
      "  className?: string",
      "}",
      "",
      "function ${1:} ({ className }: Props) {",
      "  return (",
      "    <div className={className}>",
      "      ${0}",
      "    </div>",
      "  );",
      "}",
      "",
      "export default styled(${1:}).attrs({ className: ${1:}.name })``"
    ],
    "description": "Create a default-exported, styled React Component."
  }
}
```
